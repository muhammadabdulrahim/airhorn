# Airhorn Ctrl+Z

A useless Windows application made as a joke between friends. It plays an airhorn sound effect when ctrl+z is running. Use it if you want to be annoying. Source is open. Do whatever you'd like with it. I'm sorry this exists. It's really just a joke. Why did I code it in C? Because it's a joke. Don't take it seriously.

FMOD is used for audio-handling. It probably is overkill to include it. Fork your own solutions. Neat!

## Build instructions

## Known Bugs

* ctrl+z in other applications may stop working, leaving you with only airhorn sounds. This might actually be a feature, though it is unintended...
